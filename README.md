# Toronto Custom Woodworking
After high school, a close friend and I started a business making custom furniture. Our first two projects were river tables, made from pieces of live edge wood with a “river” of epoxy. After these tables, interest in our work began to grow and we gained a larger client base. For each client, we create 3D CAD models of table and leg designs that will best fit their space and style. The furniture is all hand made using our own tools and tools from a local tool library.
